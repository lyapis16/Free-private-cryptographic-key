Free private cryptographic key

A cryptographic key is a special set of data that is used to encrypt and decrypt information sent over the network. Crypto keys are used to determine authenticity codes and to verify electronic digital signatures.

The success of decryption will depend on the key used, and if for any reason access to it is lost, it will be impossible to decrypt the data.
